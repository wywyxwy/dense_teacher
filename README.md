## Requirements
* [cvpods](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/cvpods)

## Get Started

* install cvpods locally (requires cuda to compile)
```shell

python3 -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/cvpods.git'
# (add --user if you don't have permission)

# Or, to install it from a local clone:
git clone https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/cvpods.git
python3 -m pip install -e cvpods

# Or,
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py build develop
```

* prepare datasets
```shell
cd /path/to/cvpods/datasets
ln -s /path/to/your/coco/dataset coco

```
* start training
```shell
cd DenseTeacher/coco-p10
pods_train --dir .
# Evaluation will be automatically start after each epoch
```
